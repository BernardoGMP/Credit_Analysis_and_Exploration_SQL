This project uses SQL (Structured Query Language) in the AWS (Amazon Web Services) platform to explore the data and extract useful insights. 
The services utilized to process the data were Amazon S3 (to create the bucket and store the data) and Amazon Athena (to write and run the queries). 
The analysis is written in the notebook file: **project_main_notebook.ipynb**.
