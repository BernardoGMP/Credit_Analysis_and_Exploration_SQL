The Data\nFirstly, I’ll introduce the concept behind each variable in the database:\n\n* age (int) - is simply the client's age\n* gender (string) - the client's gender (\"F\" for \"Female\" and \"M\" for \"Male\")\n* dependents (int) - how many people does the client financially support\n* degree (string) - client's level of formal education\n* marital_status (string) - client's marital status (\"single\", \"married\" or \"divorced\")\n* annual_salary (string) - client's annual salary (divided in ranges)\n* card_type (string) - type of card given to the client by the bank\n* products_qtt (int) - quantity of bank products acquired by the client\n* iterations_12m (int) - number of iterations/transactions in the last 12 months\n* inactive_months_12m (int) - number of months the customer was inactive in the last 12 months\n* credit_limit (float) - client's credit limit in the bank\n* transaction_values_12m (float) - sum all client's transactions in the last 12 months\n* transaction_qtt_12m (int) - quantity of client's transactions in the last 12 months\n\nThe original data (in portuguese) is available in Andre Marco Perez's GitHub at: https://github.com/andre-marcos-perez/ebac-course-utils/tree/main/dataset (credito.csv)\n\nThe data translated to english by me is available in my github: https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL\n\nThe services utilized to process the data were **Amazon S3** (to create the bucket and store the data) and **Amazon Athena** (to write and run the queries), both part of **AWS** (Amazon Web Services).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## III. Exploring the Data\nFor the first step of the analysis, we’ll take a closer look at each variable individually. We'll do different analysis for **(A) Numerical Variables** and **(B) Categorical Variables**.\n\nBut before we get into that, let's take a closer look at the dataset as a whole.\n\n**What is the size of our database and what does it looks like?**\n\nIf we run the following Query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows\nFROM credit;\n```\n\nWe get the following result:\n\n![](https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL/blob/main/img/exploratory/total_rows.png?raw=true)\n\nWe already know there are 13 columns in this database. So in total there are **33332** cells in our database, which firsts rows and columns look like this:\n\n![](https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL/blob/main/img/exploratory/table_preview.png?raw=true)\n\nWe get the result above by executing the following Query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM credito LIMIT 10;\n```\n\nNow that we have seen the data structure as a whole, let's take a look at each individual column:\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### A. Numerical Variables\n#### i. Age (int)\n\n**Description:** The client's age\n\n**Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    MIN(age) AS min_age, \n    ROUND(AVG(age), 2) AS avg_age, \n    MAX(age) AS max_age\nFROM credit\n```\n\n**Result:**\n\n![](https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL/blob/main/img/exploratory/age.png?raw=true)\n\n**Observation:**\nIn this sample we don't have any clients under 26 years old or over 73 years old. It might be a bit surprising, as it seems a bank would have some clients closer to the age of 18, but perhaps this bank has specific rules or market strategy that does not target a younger public.\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### ii. Dependants (int)\n\n**Description:** How many people does the client financially support.\n\n**Query 1:**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    MIN(dependents) AS min_dep, \n    ROUND(AVG(dependents), 2) AS avg_dep, \n    MAX(dependents) AS max_dep\nFROM credit\n```\n\n**Result 1:**\n\n![](https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL/blob/main/img/exploratory/dependants.png?raw=true)\n\n**Query 2:**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    dependents,\n    COUNT(dependents) AS count\nFROM credit\nGROUP BY dependents\nORDER BY dependents ASC\n```\n\n**Result 2:**\n\n![](https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL/blob/main/img/exploratory/dependants%202.png?raw=true)\n\n**Observation:**\nThe minimal value for the \"dependents\" value is \"0\", which represents clients that don't support anyone but themselves financially. The maximum value is “5”, but the average is close to “2”, meaning that on average a client supports two dependents financially. It’s most likely that dependents are children, but other possibilities include parents, grandparents and spouses.\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### iii. Products_qtt (int)\n**Description:** Quantity of bank products acquired by the client\n\n**Query 1:**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    MIN(products_qtt) AS min_pro, \n    ROUND(AVG(products_qtt), 2) AS avg_pro, \n    MAX(products_qtt) AS max_pro\nFROM credit\n```\n\n**Result 1:**\n\n![](https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL/blob/main/img/exploratory/products_qtt.png?raw=true)\n\n**Query 2:**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    products_qtt,\n    COUNT(products_qtt) AS count\nFROM credit\nGROUP BY products_qtt\nORDER BY products_qtt ASC\n```\n\n**Result 2:**\n\n![](https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL/blob/main/img/exploratory/products_qtt_2.png?raw=true)\n\n**Observation:**\nThe lowest possible value for “products_qtt” is “1”, which might be the bank account itself or the credit card (if the sample only considers clients that have credit cards). Most clients have more than one product, as the average value of this variable is “4.36”. Some of these products might be loans, mortagages, insurances or investments.\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### iv.

The clients that have made the most iterations did only 5 iterations in the last 12 months and 165 clients have not done a single iteration in that same period. This goes to show that the product we are analyzing is probably not a product that has high liquidity. It might be a savings or long term investment account of some sorts. That could also be the reason why the youngest clients in our database are 26 years old. The clients that use this low-iteration product might be people who are at a point in their lives that they are starting to save money for the future or for their children, while young adults (under 26 years old) might not be saving money yet, but studying and/or starting their careers. \n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### v.

However, there are those who are inactive 6 out of 12 months. In contrast, there are also those who are active every month of the year. \n\nWhen we run a query to count each occurrence it is possible to see that most clients are inactive between 1 to 3 months a year, while customers who are active every month or more than 4 months are rarer occurrences. \n\n---\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### vi.

This variable allied with others might show some evidence of gender disparity. \n\n---\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### ii.

In this variable, once more we see missing values labeled as “na”. The missing values is this category (116) are fewer than those in the “degree” category (346).\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### iv. Annual Salary (string)\n**Description:** client's annual salary (divided in ranges)\n\n**Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    annual_salary,\n    COUNT (annual_salary) AS quantidade\nFROM credit\nGROUP BY annual_salary\nORDER BY quantidade DESC\n```\n\n**Result:**\n\n![](https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL/blob/main/img/exploratory/annual_salary.png?raw=true)\n\n**Observation:** The category with the most clients is the lowest income category (less than $40K). \n\nIn contrast, the category with the least clients is the highest income category ($120k+). The middle categories have about the same quantity distributed between them.

Comparing Data\n\nNow that we have taken a closer look at each variable individually, let's use SQL to help us identify patterns between then. I will use motivating questions to help guide our queries.\n\n### i) Are women given less credit limit than men?\n\nFor that we will run the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    gender,\n    ROUND(AVG(credit_limit), 2) AS avg_credit\nFROM credit\nGROUP BY gender\n```\n\nAnd get the following result:\n\n![](https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL/blob/main/img/analysis/avg_credit.png?raw=true)\n\n\nWe can clearly see that on average women get almost **half the credit** that is offered to men, indicating a gender-bias in the insitution credit system. But perhaps the credit offer is not directly affected by the gender. It may be a reflection of another variable that is commonly affected by gender in a society: annual salary. Let's use our next question to analyse that possibility. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### ii) Do female clients have an annual salary smaller than male clients (on average)?\n\nFor this question we will run two queries divided by gender:\n\n**Query 1:**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    annual_salary,\n    COUNT(gender) AS count\nFROM credit\nWHERE gender = 'F'\nGROUP BY annual_salary\nORDER BY count DESC\n```\n\n\n![](https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL/blob/main/img/analysis/annual_salary_count_F.png?raw=true)\n\n**Query 2:**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    annual_salary,\n    COUNT(gender) AS count\nFROM credit\nWHERE gender = 'M'\nGROUP BY annual_salary\nORDER BY count DESC\n```\n\n![](https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL/blob/main/img/analysis/annual_salary_count_M.png?raw=true)\n\n\nAll female clients earn **less than '60k' a year**, while most male clients earn **over '60k' a year**, with some earning **over '120k' a year**. There is a clear gender disparity being represented here. It is possible to associate women having on average less credit available than men to women being paid less than men.\n\nSo even if gender itself is not considered in the system that evaluates how much credit each client may be eligible for, nevertheless women might be hindered in relation to men as a reflection of this social disparity. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### iii) Do client's that have more products have more credit available?\n\nWith this question we want to see if a client who has acquired more products from the company is given a greater credit limit. For that we will run the following query:\n\n**Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    products_qtt,\n    ROUND(AVG(credit_limit), 2) AS avg_lim\nFROM credit\nGROUP BY products_qtt\nORDER BY products_qtt ASC\n```\n\n![](https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL/blob/main/img/analysis/avg_limit_x_product_qtt.png?raw=true)\n\nWe can clearly see that the quantity of products does not follow a linear correlation with the quantity of products acquired by the client. Surprisingly, the clients who have the biggest average credit limit are the ones who have only one product. One might think that having more products would make a client be considered more reliable by the company, but that does not appear to be the case.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### iv) What is the degree of customers that spend the most?\n\nConsidering that client expanse is a relevant information for most financial products, it can be useful to understand which type of customer has the biggest transaction value. For this query we will calculate the standard deviation as well as the average for each degree.\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    degree,\n    ROUND(AVG(transaction_values_12m), 2) AS avg_trans_val,\n    ROUND(STDDEV(transaction_values_12m), 2) AS stdev_trans_val\nFROM credit\nGROUP BY degree\nORDER BY avg_trans_val\n```\n\n![](https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL/blob/main/img/analysis/degree_x_trans_val.png?raw=true)\n\nThe range between the highest spending degree (bachelor) and the lowest spending degree (high school) is not very wide. Therefore, \"degree\" may not be the most reliable variable to guide a marketing strategy to increase transaction value. It is curious to observe, though, that clients with no formal education spend more than clients with a high school degree and that clients with a bachelor's degree spend more than those with master's and doctorate's.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### v) Does the number of dependents affect the quantity of transactions?\n\nBy better understanding how the client’s characteristics affect their behavior, it is possible to create products that are better suited for them. Let’s run the following query to see if we can get some useful insight:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    dependents,\n    ROUND(AVG(transaction_qtt_12m), 2) AS avg_trans_qtt,\n    ROUND(STDDEV(transaction_qtt_12m), 2) AS stdev_trans_qtt,\n    COUNT(dependents) AS count\nFROM credit\nGROUP BY dependents\nORDER BY dependents ASC\n```\n\n![](https://github.com/BernardoGMP/Credit_Analysis_and_Exploration_SQL/blob/main/img/analysis/dependents_x_trans_qtt.png?raw=true)\n\nIt’s clear to see that as the number of dependents grows the average quantity of transactions lowers. One possible hypothesis is that client’s that have more dependents wish to save more for the future, as more people would benefit should a fatality happen to the householder. By having this information we can tailor a product that benefits those who wish to save more, or perhaps offer an insurance that may also help the dependents should necessity arise. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## V. Conclusion\n\nIn this project I ran several queries in the AWS platform to analyze a database with 2564 rows and 13 columns. The objective was better understanding a financial institution’s client’s characteristics and behavior in order to reach useful insight. Here is a summary of what I found:\n\n- The client’s age ranges from 26 to 76 with an average of 45.91.\n- Most clients have at least one dependent.\n- Most clients have at least 4 products.\n- Client’s don’t make more than 5 iterations a year.\n- Most clients are inactive between 1 to 3 months a year.\n- Roughly 60% of the clients are male.\n- More than 50% have a bachelor’s degree or higher education.\n- Most clients are married.\n- Female clients are given half the credit limit that males receive.\n- Female clients also tend to earn less than their counterparts.\n- The average limit does not seem to be directly linked to the quantity of products.\n- Client’s education does not seem to be linked to transaction values.\n- Clients with more dependents usually make less transactions.\n\nBusiness insight:\n- It might be interesting for the company to explore the possibility of targeting a younger audience (under 26 years old).\n- Offering products that are beneficial to client’s that have more dependents (such as savings accounts for college) might be a good plan.\n- Further investigating if female clients are receiving less credit because of a gender bias is advised. \n- Examining if client’s with more products might be eligible for more credit might be lucrative, as they are more likely to stay loyal to the company.\n\nThe quantity of data in this set enables many more analysis possibilities. With a clearer insight of the company’s reality and objectives, the possibility of generating useful insight is even greater.","metadata":{}}]}
